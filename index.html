<h3> About </h3> 
  I am an FSMP Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.imj-prg.fr/en/">Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche</a> at Sorbonne Université. 
 Here is a link to my <a href="https://dconnery-grigg.github.io/CV2024.pdf">CV</a>.
 </p>
<p>
I am interested in geometry and dynamics, and especially the interplay between the two. 
My main research focus these days is the study of Hamiltonian and symplectic dynamical systems, particularly through the lens of Floer theory and pseudo-holomorphic techniques.

<h3> Some principles: </h3>
  <p>As someone who both quite enjoys teaching mathematics, and who has spent a good deal of time over the years doing it, I'm a firm believer in the importance of Federico Ardila-Mantilla's axioms (articulated <a href="https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf">here</a>): 
  </p> 
  <ul>
  <li> Axiom 1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries. </li>
  <li> Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. </li>
  <li> Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs. </li>
  <li> Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. </li>
  </ul>
  Curious about something? Drop me a line: 
  <ul>
    <li><p>I believe that scholars have a fundamental duty to communicate with the public about their subjects of expertise, and help them navigate the terrain. Consequently, if you have a question about mathematics, don't be shy. 
      Please feel free to reach out and I will do my best to reply to you as promptly as my obligations allow. Hopefully with something that is helpful. </p></li>
